This repository is dedicated to my submissions to CS50x's projects. CS50x is the online version of Harvard University's introduction to computer science and programming.

### Week 0 | Scratch üò∫

#### My project: Soccer Pong

My Scratch project is a simple soccer game that resembles the legendary Pong. The commands are pretty straightforward: up and down arrows move you character and the spacebar kicks the ball. If you score more goals than the away team you win!
